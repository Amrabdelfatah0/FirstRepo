                Megan Searfoss has been hoarding sneakers in Connecticut.
                
                Ms. Searfoss, the owner of two running stores in Darien and Ridgefield, Conn.
                , would normally have about 3,000 pairs of shoes in stock ahead of the holiday season.
                 But as she watched supply chain concerns in Vietnam mount this summer and
                into the fall, she secured a new storage facility and is now carrying around 4,100 pairs.
                
                It’s a costly gamble for Ms. Searfoss, who said she was extended about $165,000 more than she would typically be in
                November because of worries about potential shortages.
                
                “It’s placing a big bet and anticipating that what all the analysts are saying is correct,” Ms.
                 Searfoss said. “Usually,
                we get through the New York City Marathon and then we stop buying shoes — we sell off what we have and go into January
                super, super lean. But we’re being told not to do that because there’s just not going to be any shoes.”
                
                The buildup of running shoes in Connecticut is just one example of how supply chain woes and pandemic-related shortages
                are affecting thousands of small businesses around the United States this holiday season. While the widespread
                availability of vaccines is translating into a busier shopping season than last year, businesses of all sizes are
                grappling with the impact from factory shutdowns overseas, backups at ports, and trucking and other labor shortages.
                The unpredictability this year has forced many small businesses to make buying decisions months or weeks earlier than
                they normally would and to tie up more of their cash in inventory, which can be risky.
                
                “The big thing is you really have to order in advance,” said Dan Quinn, an owner of What We Make, a furniture business
                in Algonquin, Ill., which sells tables and other wares through Etsy. “I’ve got 14 weeks of projects. I need to get most
                of that material in house as fast as possible and keep buying it until you have a stockpile basically.”
